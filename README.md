# MorePotions
This is a complete, fan-made mod for the game Slay the Spire that adds new potions and events to the game.

Developed with Java and built with Maven. 

Must be used in conjuction with STS Library for compatibility and the STS Modloader.

Through this project, I was able to learn many things. First of all, thanks to everyone at the Slay the Spire modding community for answering all my questions (looking at you Kio and Reina <3). It was my first time being a part of a big group of programmers and I learned a lot from everyone. I also learned how to decompile jar files and build java projects using Maven. One of the biggest skills I developed was from looking at the decompiled jar file and figuring out how the project works and how the major parts are connected. The next time I am thrust into a big project, I feel like I will be much better prepared (especially when they have comments, unlike the decompiled jar file!).
